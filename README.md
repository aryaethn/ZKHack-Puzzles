# ZKHack Puzzles

A collection of my solutions to ZKHack puzzles, demonstrating various cryptographic attacks and zero-knowledge proof vulnerabilities.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to ZKHack puzzles that explore different aspects of zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives, and their potential vulnerabilities. Each puzzle demonstrates important concepts in cryptography and helps understand the security considerations in zero-knowledge proof systems.

## Important Note

In writing the codes for each challenge, and writing the README.md and Solutions.md, the Cursor AI has been utilized to help writing better and well-structured codes, because I am mostly a researcher (academic style), not a developer.
